The Argument
So while I have to wait for the tag ban to be lifted, I figured I would work a little bit on my next biggest passion outside of new provinces and tags to play with, expanding cultures. Personally I believe that several European cultures need expanding. It is something that I am happy to do myself and would enjoy working on, but I wanted to see if anyone else had input or concerns they would like to share first.
I have noticed that we seem to be moving towards the route of consolidating cultures more and more, and to me this is a big mistake both historically and gameplay wise. Historically, one of the defining points of the Early Modern Era was the consolidation of small, separated fiefdoms and feudal states into larger, more centralized states. This wasn’t only in a political nature, but a cultural one as well. The simple truth is that in 1444 language and culture had not been coalesced into singular forms in any state, European or otherwise. As far as gameplay goes, I’ve seen a lot of people complain about additional cultures making it difficult to build empires quickly and manage them, Hehe well welcome to real world historical issues with empire building folks! Joking aside, it really isn’t that difficult to manage in EU4 as it is, culture is one of the less involving mechanics of the game. Culture conversion really isn’t that difficult or expensive, specifically for cultures within your own culture group. It really only takes a bit of time and expense, nothing a pro like you can’t handle.
As far as one province cultures (OPCs?) go I have a hard time understanding the stigma against them. Are they a tiny, excessive detail? Maybe I guess, but hey details are cool in my book and tbf cultures really don’t take that much work to do, I like it personally! Those cultures that make up one province tended to be those that stuck around for a long time and tended to be a bit of a pain for those trying to integrate them. Some might say that they are too much of a nerf for the player, or players will just culture switch right away. Well If someone playing with a small culture wants to switch them I guess they can, it happened in history quite a bit. I don’t see that as a reason to limit OPCs though. Simply put, I personally love playing OPC, OPM tags, it’s a load of fun. You should try it too :wink: ;P
I guess I don’t agree with the philosophy that making the game easier to play being equal to it being more fun. An easy game gets boring fast, hence why not everyone plays as the Ottomans. Managing cultures can be frustrating yes, but to me that increases the difficulty, player involvement, and realism, therefore making a more enjoyable experience. I like Chess a lot more than Checkers for this very reason, checkers is easier but the difficulty involved in chess, the strategy, thinking ahead, and planning make it a much more enjoyable game

Want to experience what it was like to try and create a global empire in Europe in 1444? A big part of that was uniting people under a singular cultural banner, which took time and energy. If we can make the game more realistic and interesting to play, then by all means let’s do it!

Definitions of Culture
So before I really get started, I figured I should take time to explain what I am using to define cultural differentiation and why…
Language: I’ll be upfront and say language =/= culture, so don’t start lol. BUT the truth is that language is one of the major defining points of what a culture is. It is very hard to have a similar culture to someone you don’t understand whatsoever. Often linguistic differences and dialects arise from the same reasons unique cultures arise, namely the ones mentioned below. So, we can use language as a good marker of where cultural lines can be drawn French and Germanic languages are a good example here, “culturally” they were rather similar, but having one large French or German culture is simply not an accurate representation of the times. How do we divide them up? Well languages and dialects are a useful tool. Putting it this way, I will try not to use language as the sole basis for defining culture, but it will be a good roadmap.
Religion: People who have different religious practices often develop different cultures, even if they speak the same language as those near them. The Maronites and Arabs are a good example of this.
General Appearance “Typical Culture Stuff”: What people wear, what they eat, how they dance, what their traditions are, how they interact with each other or people from other regions. If Group A considers Group B to be outsiders and Group B reciprocates the feelings, should they not be considered separate cultures?
Geography: Distance makes the heart grow fonder, and causes cultures to diverge. There really isn’t a whole lot different between American English and Standard English linguistically, but the distance and years of separation have caused cultural uniqueness. Mountains, oceans, forests, rivers, lakes, and just vastness of distance all acted as barriers, creating separation of people and  in so doing different cultures develop. Any time I see a geographically huge culture a red flag goes up, as even today it is impossible to maintain vast cultural singularity over vast areas (though maybe the internet is changing this a bit). Islands are especially hotbeds for unique cultures, as in places like Polynesia where languages are remarkably similar but yet there are unique cultural differences due mainly to separation
Livelihood: While Europe was not as wrapped up in Caste style systems as other parts of the world, throughout history whatever a person does for their livelihood is a large part of who they are. Often people groups are defined by what they were good at, be it herding, nomadism, pastoralism, farming, crafting, trading, or etc.Over time castes and livelihood can develop. their own language, culture, and even race.
Ethnicity/Race: Usually it’s pretty certain that where there is a different ethnicity in a region it most likely has its own culture. Whether we classify that as being within a different culture group is probably safer discussing case by case. 

So here is the fun part…
Cultural Additions
Baltic - Implemented
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_languages#Eastern_Baltic_languages
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_regions_of_Latvia
-Curonian/Korsi: Old Curonian remained separate as a language from Latvian and Baltic German until the 16th century, which I will remind us is 100 years after the game starts, give or take. Curonian people are noted taking part in the Livonian Wars of the 1550s-1560s. A remnant of the Curonians remain on the Curonian Spit known as the Kursenieki, which have mixed a lot with German elements but are still quite unique.

-Samogitian: Many today still consider themselves ethnically Samogitian, known specifically for their staunch clinging onto their Pagan traditions and religion. In many ways a mix of Lithuanian and Latvian cultures.

Finnic - Implemented
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnic_languages
-Livonian/Liv: A very small remnant of Livonian speakers exist today, and I think they would be just a tad frustrated at being labeled Estonian. In the 13th century there were over 30,000 Livonian speakers. It should be noted too that they had a preference towards Lutheranism
Provinces: 3
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livonian_language

-Veps/Vepsian: A Finnic group along Lake Onega, almost universally classified separately from the Karelians. Still around today, good and strong
Provinces: 3
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veps_language
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vepsians

-Voros/South Estonian: A large, unique group to this day. Though split into several dialects, Voros is by far the largest so I went with them as the representative name so to speak. It seems Seto may have been an extension of Voros anyways, with the main difference being that the Setos practice Orthodox Christianity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setos
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Estonian

-Votic (Excluded on orders): I know this really seems like a stretch, but here are some important things to note about the Votes. 
Most of them were deported after the Muscovites took over the region
Novgorod had named one of their administrative divisions after them, so they were regionally prominent
Many Votes were deported to Latvia by the Teutons from 1444-1447,
They were still Pagan in the 1500s, taking years of work until they converted to Christianity,
In the 17th Century under Swedish rule they staunchly fought conversion from Orthodoxy into Lutheranism
Under Swedish rule many moved to Finland
Up through Swedish rule it is noted that Votes really only married other Votes
After all the migration and deportation, in 184, the number of Votes was noted as 5,148
More Votes fled the Soviets to Finland or were dispersed by Stalin in the 20th Century, 
There are still Votes around today, well, 8 of them as of the 2011 census.
Provinces: 2? Just so you know, they would be in the Yama province and maybe even Gdov and Narva

Scandinavian - Implemented
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Germanic_languages
-Scanian: I know this one is a hotbed of debate for some reason, so please don’t hate me! From what I’ve read Scanian writing has been found in the 13th and 14th centuries. And Wiki notes “a letter from the 16th century, where the Danish Bible translators were advised not to employ Scanian translators since their language was not "proper Danish"” Scanian is either a transition from Danish to Swedish, or its own thing altogether. Please don’t confuse it the more modern Danish-Swedish hybrid it has become, but I’m more referring to the East Danish language grouping.
Provinces: 7
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanian_dialect
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanian_Law

-Norrland: Norrland has always had a separate culture from their Swedish neighbors, and independent Norrland kingdoms remained for quite a while until their eventual conquest/integration. In fact, there are several different Norrland dialects in their own right
Provinces: 6
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norrland
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norrland_dialects

-Dalecarlian: Dalecarlian is a bit of an oddball, as I’ve seen it classified as a Svean dialect and even it’s own separate branch of East Scandinavian. Regardless, the people of Dalarna are known for their unique culture and heritage.
Provinces: 1

-Trøndersk (Excluded, didn’t feel Norwegian needed split atm): This one I’ll probably get some flack for, and I’m not that hard up for it. Honestly Norwegian kind of confuses me, there seems to be several dialects but most appear to be modern. I figured going with Trondersk gives a good geographic split, and properly divides the more urbanized Southerners from the frontier dwelling Northerners, which even today have clear dialectal differences.
Provinces: 5
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%B8ndersk
https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordnorsk

-Norn: Language of the Orkney Islands, closely tied to Old Norwegian. Didn’t go extinct until 1850, and the gradual replacement by Scots didn’t begin until the 1460s
Provinces: 2
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norn_language

-Gutnish: I thought this was in before? Idk why it would be left out, sure it’s a one province culture but hey so what? It was clearly dominant in the region, I mean there was nothing else really in Gotland, and if it was there lets do the historical accurate and challenging ingame thing and include it! This is one of those geographic differences too, islands breed unique cultures
Provinces: 1
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutnish
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutes

-Faroese: More or less the exact same argument as Gutnish lol, but this one we even have in the culture files already, it just isn’t used for some reason.
Provinces: 1
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islanders
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroese_language

Italy - Will not be included, save the additions of Istriot and Dalmatian
Idk if I really wanna go here lol. So one way or the other I feel Italian needs split into some new culture groups. I know for a fact that there were some large cultural differences from one end of the peninsula to the other, and the language differences seem to back this up. So, I propose splitting the Italian culture group into Rhaetic, Cisalpine (North Italian), Italian (South), and Sardinian. Dalmatian is a potential 5 option discussed below.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language#/media/File:Romance-lg-classification-en.svg
Rhaetic
-Would include Romansh, Ladin, and Friulian
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaeto-Romance_languages
Cisalpine (North Italian)
-Would include Piedmontese, Ligurian, Lombard, Romagnol, and Venetian (debated but I think the geographic arrangement this makes  the most sense)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallo-Italic_languages
Italian (South)
-Would include Tuscan, Corsican, Umbrian, Neapolitan, and Sicilian
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Dalmatian_languages
-Addition of Dalmatian, this one is still heavily debated, but I would say it either fits here or within its own culture group. Still, it was around in the timeframe of EU4 and certainly was very unique.
Provinces: 2 at least, maybe more
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_language
-Addition of Istriot, like Dalmatian this is also highly debated but the two are usually grouped together. It is likely a mixture of a remnant Roman population, Slavs, and the “new” Italians.
Provinces: 2
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istriot_language
Sardinian (Southern Romance)
-Sardinia has always been different from the rest of Italy, even the way they ran their states was unique and not very Italian. The Sardinian language is a bit of an isolate too, often considered the most conservative Romance language. Note, the language isn’t grouped with any of the Italian languages. Sardinia has always been a bit of a historical oddball. Old Coriscan would have been classified in this group before it was Tuscanized, along with the African Romance language which may have still been around in 1444.
-Includes Sardinian
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Romance

Greek  - Implemented
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_languages
-Ionic is a pretty poor term to use for standard, mainland Greek. It is distinctly ancient Greek and only describes the root from which the majority of Greek language and culture comes from today. In its place we could call the “Standard Greek” Demotic, as it is referred to most commonly. Though a more modern term it is much more suitable than Ionic. Byzantine or Koine Greek would be other terms that would be more relevant than Ionic. In fact Ionian would more accurately be used to describe the dialects of the Peloponnese. I have seen Byzantine, or Medieval, Greek referred to as Ellinikí, which has a nice ring to it.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Greek

The splits in the Greek language and culture weren’t extremely pronounced until after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. However regionally some areas were distinct, and they carried that distinct dialect/language throughout the majority of the timeline.

-Attic/Old Athenian (Excluded in order to keep Greek and Greece formation from being problematic): Closely related with Maniot, was distinct until the 1830s or so when Athens became the capital of Greece. Whenever a language sticks around distinctly for that long it’s a good note that the people had a strong culture.
Provinces: 1
https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-language/Modern-Greek#ref603504
-Ionian-Peloponnesian: I know this was previously in as well. While the Morean language differences aren’t extreme, there are enough cultural and geographic differences otherwise to warrant the inclusion. Would include Peloponnese and the Ionian Islands 
Provinces: 10
 -Cretan: Could include the Cyclades as well. Islands create unique cultures, and Crete has had plenty of separation for a long time. Very Greek, but very Cretan as well.
Provinces: 4
-Epirote: Another large group that warrants inclusion for geographic regions. That being said the Epirote people are distinct in their own ways. Could be used just to represent North Epirote in Himara, Corfu, and etc. as  well
Provinces: 7
-Dodecanesian/Aegean: From Chios on South. More closely related to Cypriot than the mainland Greek dialects.
Provinces: 3
-Urum/Rumeíka: Crimean/Ukrainian Greeks, Urum are those who speak a Turkish language while the Rumeika have maintained Greek. They both seem to have a rather Greek culture though and most likely have the same roots. This will replace Pontic Greeks on Crimea. During the Russo-Turkish War Catherine the Great invited them to found the town of Mariupol in the southern Ukraine.. It also appears that Theodoro would have been a Greek state with predominantly Gothic people.  
Provinces: 3
-After the fall of Byzantium Greek culture became more divided, so if Byzantium falls Standard Greek will be split into the following cultures…
Rumelian: East Thrace
Thracian: Northern and Western Thrace
Makedon: Predominantly Southern Macedon
Thessalian: Thessaly
Roumeliote: Continental, mainland Greek, Thessaly on South
Mikrasiátes: Anatolia and parts of the Aegean

-A note on Maniot (Included) and Tzakonian: I love these cultures, they are so unique and fiercely independent. The problem is that they were not large enough to really dominate any province. That being said, if we split the Mystras province both could be in :wink:

West Slavic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_historical_regions
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialects_of_Polish

-Mazovian: Of all the Polish splits this one is the most certain to me, still has a culture and character that is unique from the rest of Poland.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazovia
-Małopolska: Southern Polish region, Poland was still somewhat fragmented at this time.
-Wielkopolska . Northwestern Polish region, see above.
-Polabian: The Drevani remnant of the Polabians would have been going strong in Dannenberg. Not much info here, but they were highly Germanzied by now. Last Polabian speaker died in the 1800s.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCchow-Dannenberg
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polabian_Slavs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polabian_language
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drevani
-Moravian: For some reason I assumed this was in already. Pretty well a stereotype unique culture imo, many still consider themselves Moravians today.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravians
-Chodove/Chod: This one may seem memeish too, but an interesting history and still relatively distinct today. An ethnic group recruited from the Carpathian mountains as border guards between the Czech and German lands
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chodov%C3%A9
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chod_dialect
-Gorals: Polish/Silesian highlanders on the border of Slovakia. Would probably have 2 provinces. Speak the Podhale dialect
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorals


East Slavic
East Slavic needs a bit of a redo, I don’t think it’s extremely accurate as is. I will be looking into it, but there doesn’t seem to be much info. These two warrant an addition though…

-Pomors (Implemented): The Russian explorers/colonizers of the White Sea. Originally from Novgorod but have developed a culture in and of its own and were important traders and settlers in the region. Effectively ran their area of influence as a fief of Novgorod. Free peasants without any real form of hierarchy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomors
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomor_dialects

-Rusyns: Ruthenian people of the Carpathian Mountains, often including the Dolinyans, Boykos, Hutsuls and Lemko. Sometimes not considered much more than “Highland Ukrainians”, most consider them to be a completely separate branch of East Slavic languages. Regardless, they have a unique culture and language, having been influenced by a variety of other groups. Their origins are still a bit of a mystery
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusyns

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutsuls
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemkos
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boykos
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonian_Rusyns

-Cossack

-Siberian: Will look for another name. I’m really not sure where to go with this, as it was really just Cossacks and Russian serfs that settled Siberia. Can’t find much evidence of a mixed or emerging culture of any sort. Tbf, most of Siberia wasn’t ethnically Russian until the late 1800s, only the important cities predominantly on the coasts

-Poleshuk/Polesian: The area between Red Ruthenia and Belorus, considered its own micro-language and a unique ethnic group. Not much info on them though. Mainly included because they don’t fit neatly in to any of the other groups.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polesia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poleshuks

-Cherven/Red Ruthenia/Galician: Ruthenian needs split, we already have White Ruthenian (aka Belorussian), why not add Red Ruthenian as well? There are further dialectel divisions of Ukrainian we could use, but between this and Cossack it should be farely well covered. This would more or less include the Galician and Polish controlled regions
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Ruthenia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherven_Cities

-Podillian/Volynian: Essentially lowlanders, while part of the modern Ukrainian language there seems to be a relatively distinct culture here. Once again I’m struggling to find info but this seems to be a logical split.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podolia
 
A full list of Ukrainian dialects/ethnic groups I have found includes Slobozhanians, Volynians, Podolyans, Dniprians, Siverians, Poleshuks, Halychans, and Steppe/Cossack. I do feel this may be a little much and seems more modern, so for now I’d suggest separating Ruthenian along the lines of Black (Standard central Ukrainian, Kiev and Chernigov), Red (Galicia, West Slavic influenced regions), White (Belorus), Podillian (Podolia, aka southwestern lowlands) Polesian/Poleshuk, and Cossack (Steppe regions).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_dialects
https://www.ukraine.com/culture/languages/

South Slavic
There are a few South Slavic cultures that really should be added, namely Macedonian and Montenegrin/Zetan. However there is a lot more detail that could be added if we wish to.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Slavic_languages

-Montenegrin/Zetan: Fiercely independent, fiercely Christian, strong mountain people.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrins
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrin_language

-Macedonian: A slightly controversial term, but the Macedonian Slavs were a mixture of other cultures and languages that formed a unique culture in and of their own.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonians_(ethnic_group)
Sclavene: Greek-influenced Slavs. Found throughout Macedonia and Thrace 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_speakers_of_Greek_Macedonia
I went with Sclavinian, it’s a Byzantine term for Slavs in Greek regions.

-Chakavian/Dalmatian Slavs: Slavs/Croatians of the Dalmatian Coast
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakavian


-Torlak: Another Serbian-Bulgarian transitional language and culture. Predominantly shepherds closely tied to or even slightly synonymous with Shopi
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torlakian_dialect 


-Slavonian

-Zachlumian: Serbs of the Hum and Makarska regions

-Torbeshi: Used for Muslim Slavs, South Slavic cultures would change to this upon religious conversion or something along that lines. At least Bulgarians

-Gallo: The mixed pot region between Brittany and France. Still bore a lot of Gaulish influence, but was always viewed as distinct by both the French and Bretons, due to them not originating from Briton.

-Manx (Implemented): This I know was in, seriously now why was it deleted hmm? One province, ok, small and insignificant, sure, but was it there? Well, yes. Was it unique? Yes. Was it the majority culture? Absolutely. Is a unique culture still around today? In force. Once again I’ll turn to my argument that generalization and a consolidation is not a good thing for our position as a historical and gameplay driven mod. A Manx world conquest should be tough to do, for political and cultural reasons, and that’s ok it’s fun that way!

-Baltic German: The Baltic German ethnicity really started from the original movement of German people into the Baltic region in the 12th Century, and in many ways incorporated aspects of local Baltic culture and language. They were centered in urban areas, specifically Riga and Dorpat, but also made up the local German nobility that formed the Livonian Confederation and Duchy of Courland. They even tried to form their own state in WW1. They are related to, but distinct from their Prussian neighbors.

-Gagauz: A Turkish, Orthodox ethnic group in modern day Romania. Currently represented by a Turkish culture Isaccea province. It could be argued that the Gagauz didn’t form until much later, but there was certainly a unique, Orthodox, Turkish group in the area in 1444.

Karaim/Kyrmchaks: Ethnic Jews, many Turkish or Tartar speaking which would be a more recent development, but in 1444 most would have spoken Kyrmchk or Karaim which would have Kipchak or Khazar roots. I believe that the Matrega province was predominantly Jewish religiously and culturally, as the (Jewish) Genoese ruler married a local Jewish “princess” along with “Jewish Princes” in Tamatarkha according to Wiki. All of Crimea/Gazaria was a mixed pot really, but the Mongol and later Genoese presence created an influx of Jewish people. There really ought to be a Tmutarakan/Matrega tag as a Gazarian vassal too.
