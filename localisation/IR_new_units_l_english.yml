 nhs_greek1_Roman_LevyDESCR:0 "An eclectic collection of city and peasant militias, foreign mercenaries, and professional and semi-professional soldiers hailing from old Byzantium. These men are a motley crew, with only some hardened veterans possessing any real discipline, but they're all the empire can call upon."
 nhs_greek5a_Pronoia_InfantryDESCR:0 "Semi-professional soldiers who go out on campaign in exchange for the right to collect taxes on certain properties. Decently equipped and with decent discipline, these soldiers are effective, but somewhat unreliable, and can be levied in greater numbers than their mercenary counterparts."
 nhs_greek5b_Latinkon_InfantryDESCR:0 "Old foreign mercenaries and their descendants, usually Italian or Frankish, who fled Europe with their employers. These men are well-equipped and highly disciplined, but are relatively few in number and are expensive to maintain."
 nhs_greek10a_Crossbow_AllagionDESCR:0 "These small regiments, or Allagia, are comprised of Elysians, and feature armored infantry wielding chiefly crossbows, which are powerful and easy to use, and wield halberds and pikes in melee."
 nhs_greek10b_Barbaroi_Mercenary_WarbandDESCR:0 "Native Barbaroi warriors recruited to serve Elysia as mercenaries. These units are numerous and well-versed in skirmish and ambush tactics, but are ill-disciplined. Useful auxiliaries, they shouldn't be relied upon to hold the main line of battle."
 nhs_greek14a_Megala_AllagiaDESCR:0 "These 'great' Allagia are upscaled versions of the original Allagion regiments, and contain much of the same equipment and organization, aside from the introduction of harquebuses into some regiments. Heavy armor, crossbows, and halberds remain the order of the day."
 nhs_greek14b_Mistophoroi_TagmataDESCR:0 "Taken from the word for 'Mercenary,' these battalions are comprised of a mix of native Barbaroi, Varangians, and even the odd Spartan. Serving under Elysian commanders, these units are numerous and vary wildly in effectiveness."
 nhs_greek18a_Matchlock_TagmataDESCR:0 "Battalions of lightly-armored soldiers armed with muskets and arquebuses, these soldiers are an effective skirmish force, but should be wary of enemy horsemen and pikemen."
 nhs_greek18b_Halberd_TagmataDESCR:0 "These units, hearkening back to old medieval infantry, are heavily-armored and armed with versatile halberds, equally adept at forming a pike-line against cavalry or chopping away at infantry."
 nhs_greek23a_Elysian_Line_InfantryDESCR:0 "Modern units armed with muskets and swords, these regimented line infantry are among the finest in the world, incorporating tactics and stratagems from whatever works, no matter the country of origin."
 nhs_greek23b_Elysian_Light_InfantryDESCR:0 "Armed with long muskets, these soldiers are able to operate independently and are very effective skirmishers, if weak in melee combat."
 nhs_greek26a_Hikanatoi_TagmataDESCR:0 "Taking their name and standard from the ninth-century regiment, the 'Able Ones' live up to their name. These men are adept line infantry, but find their true calling as fearsome shock infantry and assault specialists."
 nhs_greek26b_Exkoubitoi_TagmataDESCR:0 "The 'Sentinels' date back to the fifth century, before the Western Empire fell, and their Elysian incarnation consists of a number of elite skirmish and light infantry units."
 nhs_greek30a_Vigla_TagmataDESCR:0 "Hearkening back to the Tagma of the same name established in the eighth century, the elite, well-equipped soldiers of the 'Watch' are fearsome heavy infantry, fielding large-calibre infantry guns and even their own light artillery units."
 nhs_greek30b_Optimatoi_TagmataDESCR:0 "Dating back originally to a sixth century elite Foederati unit, the 'Best' are well-rounded medium infantry, equally at home serving as skirmishers or as line infantry."

 nhs_greek8c_Elysian_CataphractsDESCR:0 "Armed and armored in the old style, in scale and chain; and equipped with maces, lances, and bows; these super-heavy riders are a feared addition to any force, nearly impervious to any blows the natives can strike."
 nhs_greek15c_Light_CataphractsDESCR:0 "The age of the super-heavy cavalryman armed with lance and blade is over, but the term 'Cataphract' has survived in Elysia to denote any armed rider. Unarmored horses bear lightly-armored riders armed with bows and swords to do battle as effective medium cavalry."
 nhs_greek23c_Carbine_CataphractsDESCR:0 "Light cavalry units armed with maces and shortened muskets for use as well-armed light cavalry. These riders are fast enough to escape heavy units and strong enough to fight whatever can catch them."
 nhs_greek30c_Hetaireia_GuardDESCR:0 "Named after the ninth-century Tagma, and hearkening back to the Companions of Philip and Alexander, the picked riders of the 'Company' are among the best in Elysia. Armed with carbine, sword, and mace, there is little they cannot overcome."
