 por_colonize.14.d: "After the taking Malacca by Afondo de Albuquerque, Portuguese merchants increasingly interacted with the Chinese, even discovering their shores a mere few years later. However, formal relations between the Ming Emperor and Portuguese Crown did not exist. As such, the monarch dispatched Fernão Pires de Andrade to initiate contact with the Chinese. But as the Malaccan sultans were tacit tributaries to the Ming, they were already wary of us; so when our mediators fired cannons as a supposed friendly salute, diplomatic contact was made even more tense. While immediate contact was hopefully warm, with comfortable lodging afforded to our representatives, the Ming have since accused us of piracy and kidnapping, and have since expelled Andrade and the rest of our representatives. Relations appear to have spoiled."
