 spa_colonize_hispaniola_desc:0 "Christopher Columbus first landed at Hispaniola on December 6, 1492 at a small bay he named San Nicolas. He was welcomed in a friendly fashion by the indigenous people known as the Taíno. Trading with the natives yielded more gold than they had come across previously on the other Caribbean islands and Columbus was led to believe that much more gold would be found inland. Before he could explore further, his flagship, the Santa Maria, ran aground and sank in the bay on December 24. With only two smaller ships remaining for the voyage home, Columbus built a fortified encampment, La Navidad, on the shore and left behind 21 crewman to await his return the following year. Colonization began in earnest the following year when Columbus brought 1,300 men to Hispaniola in November 1493 with the intention of establishing a permanent settlement. They found the encampment at Navidad had been destroyed and all the crewmen left behind killed by the natives. We must settle Hispaniola, as we believe the island to contain great riches that are better off in our coffers!"
 spa_west_indies_title:0 "Spanish West Indies"
 spa_west_indies_desc:0 "The Spanish West Indies was the collective name for Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. In terms of governance of the Spanish Empire, The Indies was the designation for all its overseas territories and was overseen by the Council of the Indies, founded in 1524 and based in Spain. When the crown established the Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1535, the islands of the Caribbean came under its jurisdiction. We must seek to control the entirety of the money making West Indies, truly making the region the Spanish West Indies!"

 spa_veracruz_title:0 "Veracruz"
 spa_veracrus_desc:0 "Veracruz played an important part in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire by Hernán Cortés and his expedition members. They founded Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz on May 18, 1519, as the first Spanish town in what is now Mexico. By doing so, Cortés threw off the authority of the Governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, and took authority from the town council of Veracruz and claim authority directly from the Spanish crown. A small contingent of the expedition remained at Veracruz, while the main body of conquerors moved inland"
 spa_tlaxcala_title:0 "Subsume the Tlaxcala"
 spa_tlaxcala_desc:0 "When Hernán Cortés and the Spanish landed on the Veracruz coast, they were greeted by the Totonacas, who were a subject people of the Aztecs and saw the Spanish as a way to free themselves of rule from Tenochtitlan. They allied with the Spanish, and when Cortés decided to go inland to Tenochtitlan, the Totonacas guided them to other subject peoples who would be willing to ally with them, including and especially the Tlaxcalans. However, after entering Tlaxcalan territory, the Spanish were met by a hostile Tlaxcalan force of 30,000. The Tlaxcalans fought the Spanish and their Indian allies in a number of battles, with the Spanish inflicting heavy casualties on the Tlaxcalans despite their superior numbers. We must subsume Tlaxcala, as they would make great auxiliaries & guides for Spain in our future & upcoming conquests "
 spa_cortes_title:0 "Conquista de Cortes"
 spa_cortes_desc:0 "in 1519, Cortés and his retinue set sail for Mexico. The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtemoc and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. Hernán Cortés has defied the Viceroy of Cuba and entered the Aztec heartland intent on conquest. Perhaps this situation could be exploited, and Spanish dominance over the region ensured should we support Cortés."
 spa_tarascans_title:0 "Conquer the Cazonci"
 spa_tarascans_desc:0 "After hearing about the fall of the Aztec Empire, cazonci Tangáxuan II sent emissaries to the Spanish victors. A few Spaniards went with them to Tzintzuntzan where they were presented to the ruler and gifts were exchanged. They returned with samples of gold and Cortés' interest in the Tarascan state was awakened. In 1522 a Spanish force under the leadership of Cristóbal de Olid was sent into Tarascan territory and arrived at Tzintzuntzan within days. The Tarascan army numbered many thousands but at the crucial moment they chose not to fight. Tangáxuan submitted to the Spanish administration, but for his cooperation was allowed a large degree of autonomy. This resulted in a strange arrangement where both Cortés and Tangáxuan considered themselves rulers of Michoacán for the following years: the population of the area paid tribute to them both. With the Aztec Empire conquered, we must now look to other nearby powers & integrate them into Spains colonial possessions"
 spa_sinaloa_title:0 "Establish Sinaloa"
 spa_sinaloa_desc:0 "In 1531, Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán with a force of over 10,000 men, defeated a force of 30,000 Cáhita warriors at the site of Culiacán. Beltrán de Guzmán established a Spanish and allied Indian outpost at San Miguel de Culiacán. We must establish a base which will ensure Spains hold & influence in the region"
 spa_sonora_title:0 "Settle la Sonora"
 spa_sonora_desc:0 "Jesuit priests began to work in Sonora in the 1610s in the lowlands near the coast. Originally, these missionaries worked out a peaceful compromise with the 30,000 Yaquis allowing for the establishment of more than fifty mission settlements in the Sonora river valleys. This broke down when the Jesuits opposed the native shamanic religious tradition. The Opata were more receptive to the missionaries and allied with them. After this, the Jesuits began to move into Pima and Tohono O'odham territories. Spanish exploration and missionary work was sufficient to consider the territory part of New Spain. An agreement between General Pedro de Perea and the viceroy of New Spain resulted in the general shaping of the province, initially called Nueva Navarra in 1637, but renamed Sonora in 1648. We must settle this area & convert the local natives to the One True Faith, which will making holding on to this area alot easier & further cement Spains presence in the region"

 spa_colorado_river_title:0 "El Río Colorado"
 spa_colorado_river_desc:0 "During the 16th century, the Spanish began to explore and colonize western North America. An early motive was the search for the Seven Cities of Gold, or "Cibola", rumored to have been built by Native Americans somewhere in the desert Southwest. Francisco Vásquez de Coronado's 1540–1542 expedition began as a search for the fabled Cities of Gold, but after learning from natives in New Mexico of a large river to the west, he sent García López de Cárdenas to lead a small contingent to find it. With the guidance of Hopi Indians, Cárdenas and his men became the first outsiders to see the Grand Canyon."

 spa_arizona_title:0 "Annex Arizona"
 spa_arizona_desc:0 "In 1539, Marcos de Niza, a Spanish Franciscan, became the first European to contact Native Americans. He explored parts of the present state and made contact with native inhabitants, probably the Sobaipuri. The expedition of Spanish explorer Coronado entered the area in 1540–1542 during its search for Cíbola. We must annex this region and make it safe for Spanish settlers to settle in the area, thus ensuring Spains dominence in the area"

Though it is the New Worlds equivilent of the Dead Sea back in the Old World, the lake provides a habitat for millions of native birds, brine shrimp, shorebirds, and waterfowl, which will surely be of interest to the learned men of Spain and merchants wanting exotic animals"
 spa_great_basin_title:0 "Las Provincias Internas"
 spa_great_basin_desc:0 "The Provincias Internas were the brainchild of José de Gálvez. He hit upon the idea during his time as royal Inspector General to New Spain from 1761 to 1772. His initial idea was to create a full-fledged viceroyalty or captaincy general out of the northern provinces, but the low population of the area and large military expenses of the area in comparison to its revenues, prevented this"

He sold Lanzarote to Prince Henry the Navigator for the soap trade and other income from Madeira on 9 May 1448. With the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1492, the islands are the best ports for further exploration & colonisation of Brazil, Columbia & the Caribbean and we should move to reclaim them."

Puebla was an important city and region in the history of New Spain, since it was in the center region of Spanish settlement, midway between the main port and the capital, had a large indigenous population, and drew many Spanish settlers. It supplied the capital with commercially grown agricultural products and became a center of local textile production. It was well connected to Mexico's North, particularly the silver-mining region around Zacatecas.

Lake Texcoco is best known as where the Aztecs built the city of Tenochtitlan, which was located on an island within the lake. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, efforts to control flooding by the Spanish led to most of the lake being drained, allowing a new capital for New Spain to be built.

Father Antonio de Olivares visited the site in 1709, and he was determined to found a mission and civilian settlement there. The viceroy gave formal approval for a combined mission and presidio in late 1716, as he wanted to forestall any French expansion into the area from their colony of La Louisiane to the east, as well as prevent illegal trading with the Payaya.

The Batavian Republic became a client state, the first of the "sister-republics", and later part of the French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.

In exchange for the marriage, Charles wanted the English-held area of Maine in northern France, just south of Normandy. Henry VI married the fifteen-year-old Margaret in April 1445; he did not, however, give up Maine immediately. This clause was initially kept secret, as the cession of this strategically important province was likely to cause a public backlash in England. Charles threatened Henry VI and sent envoys to pressure him; even Margaret tried to persuade Henry to give it up. Henry eventually yielded in 1448 when Charles VII threatened English garrisons with a large army."
