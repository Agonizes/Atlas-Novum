 mhondoro:0 "Mhondoro"
 mhondoro_religion_desc:1 "Mhondoro are spirit ancestors. Whether from a local family dynasty or founder, these spirits wander across the land, inhabiting maneless lions. Once they have found a host, they live in their bodies, becoming an oracle. People go to consult them, and the svikiro consumes 'bute' (snuff) to connect with the Mhondoro. The Mhondoro is usually responsible for their tribe or family, and many deal with the rain. One of the most iconic mhondoros is Mwari, who resides in the shrine of Great Zimbabwe."

They are associated with resolving disputes, and provide a major role with helping young mothers. All people who lived a long life, and that have a "proper" death become a spirit, resulting in a hierarchy of spirits. Finally, the mwene or pwiyamwene are paid homage during rain ceremonies, because they were responsible for the rain."

Black or dark blue was the sign of Enkai being happy, while red signifies Enkai being angry. Another significant color was white, which one representation of it was childbirth. The Maasai spiritual leaders, named Laibon, held a high role in their society, and were involved in healing, divination, and prophesying. It's believed by the Maasai that cattle was created by Enkai and that every cattle is rightfully theirs."

 waaq:0 "Waaq"
 waaq_religion_desc:1 "Waaqeffannaa is the Oromo faith system based on the god Waaq. Waaq was said to be born from the water, that place being called Waallaabuu. Waaqa Tokkicha (the one God) created the world and everything else. One symbol of the Oromo and Waaq is the Odaa, or the Sycamore Tree. This tree was important to Oromo mythology and was important to the Oromo themselves during the Oromo Migrations. Another tree that was important was the Acacia Tree (or ‘Garbii’). Other symbols included cows and water, as that is where Waaq was born. What sets this apart from other African religions was monotheism, rather than polytheism. Waaq was also tied to the Gadaa system, where Waaq would play a part in the rituals and government’s decisions."
