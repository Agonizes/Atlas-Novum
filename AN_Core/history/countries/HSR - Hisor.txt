# After Muhammad Juki's death his fief was split between his sons Abu Bakr, recieving the land above the Amu-Darya, and Muhammad Qasim who recieved the land below.
# When Shahrukh died in 1447 Abu took his chance and siezed his brothers domain. He then turned to the court of his uncle Ulugh-Beg, but was convicted of plotting and put to death in 1448 by his uncle.
# Hisor / Khuttalan then fell to Ulugh-Beg.
