# Big thanks to Imperialism Reinvigoration Mod Team, whom voluntarily invested huge amounts of time and work into this project
# Thanks to our partners at the EU4 and Beyond Typus Family discord servers, Plus Ultra, Third Odyssey, and Missions Expanded developers for their advice and input
# Even further thanks to the broader EU4 Community that sent me 1000s of comments, bug reports, and support. This could not have been done without you!
