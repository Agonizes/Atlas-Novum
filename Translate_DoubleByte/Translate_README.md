TO PROPERLY TRANSLATE ATLAS NOVUM:

1. Move the !Translate_DoubleByte.mod file from MANUAL-GIT-INSTALL folder to /mods folder.
2. Download and install the latest Double-Byte translate DLL from https://github.com/matanki-saito/EU4dll/releases
3. Ensure that Atlas Novum: Chinese Translation loads AFTER Atlas Novum

Notes: Please be warned, my native language is American English. I did not translate anything in Atlas Novum. If you are a native speaker and would like to help translate the mod's changes to Chinese, please reach me Discord.
